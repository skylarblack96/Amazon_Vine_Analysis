# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
In this analysis we are analyzing Amazon book reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. From the data provided we are making four tables representing information for analysis. Our customers table will have the customer ID along with how many times they have written a review. The products table will contain the book ID and book title. The review ID table will have the review ID, customer ID, product ID, product parent, and review date. Our final vine table will have review ID, star rating, helpful votes, total votes, vine, and verified purchase. The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is a bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. We will determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.

## Results
- The number of vine reviews are 5,012 compared to 109,297 non-vine reviews. 
- 2,031 reviews are 5 star vine reviews. 49,967 reviews are 5 star non-vine reviews.
- 40.5% of 5 star reviews were made by vine reviewers. 45.7% of 5 star reviews were made by non-vine reviewers.

## Summary
Based on the analyses, I do not believe there is any positivity bias for views in the vine program. Although there are not many views made by vine reviewers compared to non-vine reviewers, the percentage of 5 star reviews made by vine reviewers is below 50% and below the 5 star reviews made by non-vine reviewers. Another analysis that would help determine bias is determining the number and percent of each review from one star to 5 stars between reviews made by vine reviewers and non-vine reviewers. We could then plot the distribution of reviews to see if the data is normally distributed or skewed assisting us indetermining if there is indeed a positivity bias for views in the vine program.
